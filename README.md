# C++
- High level language 
- Improvement on the C language 

## core concets 
1. Set up
2. Variables 
3. Data types
4. if/ switch statements 
5. Loops 
6. Arrays
7. Objects

### set up 
1. Text editors(I.D.E)
2. Compilers
3. Hello world

create file - build the file - run build 
c++ runs code line by line from the top 

#### syntax
```c++
# include <iostream>

int main(){
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```
main() - where to find the executable code
return 0 - because main begins with ```int``` it has to return a number 
; - should be used to end each line of code

### lesson 2 
1. simple shape 
2. variables 
3. data types
